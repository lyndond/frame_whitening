## Introduction

This repo is associated with our project on adaptive online whitening using overcomplete projections and gain modulation. We presented this as a poster at COSYNE 2023 [1], and as a manuscript/poster at ICML 2023 [2].

## Installation

Pull this repo, `cd` to it, and `pip install -e .`

## Code to reproduce figures and experiments

The `frame_whitening/` directory contains code central to the project, including the algorithm, and utility functions. The `figures/` directory contains the ipynb files to reproduce the figures in the paper. These can be viewed online directly.
